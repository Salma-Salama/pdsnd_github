### Project Title
**BikeShare** - *Business Analysis*

### Description
BikeShare is an American business located in the 3 cities: Chicago, New York, and Washington. It rents bikes for people either for fun or to use it as a way of transportation.

Therefore, the company eased out the rental process as people can rent a bike from a station and return it back either to the same station or to another station.

Now the decision makers want to perform some analysis on the business to be able to use it for the next phase. For example, the want to know the peak timings; day of the week, hour and month.  

### Analysis Description
